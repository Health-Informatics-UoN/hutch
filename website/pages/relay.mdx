# Relay
Jobs coming from the HDR Gateway are put into a queue in Relay. [Bunny](/bunny) polls Relay for jobs, and POSTs the results when the job is completed.

## Getting started
Hutch tools are designed to be deployed together as a stack.

### Prerequisites
Docker

### Deployment
To build the stack, run

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will build the component images and compose your stack.

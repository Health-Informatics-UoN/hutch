# Relay

Relay is an application for enabling federated networks in cohort discovery.

- Relay is deployed in a centralised environment to create a federated network of subnodes.
- Relay will aggregate the results from its network of subnodes.
- Relay can request queries from any compatible upstream Task API, such as the HDR Cohort Discovery tool, or Relay itself.
- Relay enables [obfuscation](/relay/config#results-obfuscation) of query results, to simplify data governance issues. 
- Relay will return aggregated results even if a node is unavailable or fails.
- Relay container images are available for ease of [deployment](/relay/deployment) in your environment.

The code for Relay is open source, and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch-cohort-discovery).

# Welcome to Hutch Tools
Hutch provides tools for cohort discovery.

The Hutch implementation of the Executing Agent module of the TRE-FX stack is [Hutch TRE-FX](https://health-informatics-uon.github.io/hutch-trefx/).

## Getting started
Hutch tools are designed to be deployed together as a stack.

### Prerequisites
Docker

### Deployment
To build the stack, run

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will build the component images and compose your stack.

Several options have to be configured for your stack.
This is carried out by setting environment variables in the docker compose file.
Consult the pages for the relevant layer of the stack for more information.

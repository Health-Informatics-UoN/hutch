# Welcome to Hutch 
Hutch provides tools for federated activities in secure environments.

The Hutch implementation of the Executing Agent module of the TRE-FX stack is [Hutch TRE-FX](https://health-informatics-uon.github.io/hutch-trefx/).

Several options have to be configured for your stack.
This is carried out by setting environment variables in docker compose files.
Consult the pages for the relevant layer of the stack for more information.

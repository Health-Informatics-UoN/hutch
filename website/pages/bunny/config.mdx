# Configuration

Bunny can be configured using environment variables.
If you're running Bunny as part of a composed stack of containers, these are set in the `compose.yml`.
They can be found under

```yaml
services:
  # other containers, if needed
  bunny:
    depends_on:
      - db
      - relay
      - rabbitmq
    build:
      context: app/bunny
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.daemon
    environment:
      - DATASOURCE_DB_USERNAME=postgres
      - DATASOURCE_DB_PASSWORD=postgres
      - DATASOURCE_DB_DATABASE=postgres
      - DATASOURCE_DB_DRIVERNAME=postgresql
      - DATASOURCE_DB_SCHEMA=public
      - DATASOURCE_DB_PORT=5432
      - DATASOURCE_DB_HOST=db
      - TASK_API_BASE_URL=http://relay:8080/link_connector_api
      - TASK_API_USERNAME=username
      - TASK_API_PASSWORD=password
      - LOW_NUMBER_SUPPRESSION_THRESHOLD=
      - ROUNDING_TARGET=
      - POLLING_INTERVAL=5
      - COLLECTION_ID=collection_id
```

In development, if you're running Bunny outside a container, you can instead set these with a `.env` file, as described in [quickstart](/bunny/quickstart).

## Task API [#task]

```yaml
TASK_API_BASE_URL=<host>:<port>/link_connector_api
TASK_API_USERNAME=<Task API username>
TASK_API_PASSWORD=<Task API password>
TASK_API_ENFORCE_HTTPS=true
```

To configure Bunny to communicate with a Task API, such as [Relay](/relay) or RQuest, the `TASK_API` variables must be set.

- Host examples
  - If Bunny and Relay are running in the same Docker Compose stack, the host should be the Relay service name in the stack, e.g. `http://relay`.
  - If you have Relay running locally, and Bunny running locally, the host should be `http://localhost`
  - If you have any Task API running elsewhere, the host should be e.g. `https://my-task-api.com` with the correct hostname
- The Base URL should include `/link_connector_api` at the end of the path
- HTTP Requests from Bunny are authenticated by the `TASK_API_USERNAME` and `TASK_API_PASSWORD`, please put your Task API credentials here


### TASK_API_ENFORCE_HTTPS

Default: `true`

If a non-HTTPS URL is provided in `TASK_API_BASE_URL`, Bunny will throw an error. 
To explicitly allow HTTP URLs, set `TASK_API_ENFORCE_HTTPS` to `false` - in this case, Bunny will only display a warning.

Valid values:
- `true`
- `false`

```yaml
TASK_API_ENFORCE_HTTPS=true
```

### Task Type

If you would like Bunny to connect directly with Rquest, you have to add one more configuration which is `TASK_API_TYPE`.

This can only be either `a` (Availability), `b` (Distribution and PHEWAS) or `c` (AnalyticsGwas, AnalyticsGwasQuantitiveTrait, AnalyticsBurdenTest).

More guidance is available in the [Connect to RQuest](/bunny/how_to/connect_rquest) How To Guide.

## Database [#database]

The database connection is configured by the variables prefixed with `DATASOURCE_DB`

```
DATASOURCE_DB_USERNAME=<username>
DATASOURCE_DB_PASSWORD=<password>
DATASOURCE_DB_DATABASE=<database name - ignored if using Trino>
DATASOURCE_DB_DRIVERNAME=<driver name - ignored if using Trino>
DATASOURCE_DB_CATALOG=<Trino catalog name - ignored if not using Trino>
DATASOURCE_DB_SCHEMA=<database schema name>
DATASOURCE_DB_PORT=<port served by database>
DATASOURCE_DB_HOST=<database host>
DATASOURCE_USE_TRINO=
```

If using the supplied `compose.yml` and running the database in the same stack, unless you modify the database configuration, the defaults will connect Bunny to your database.
If using a remote database, change accordingly.

### DATASOURCE_DB_DRIVERNAME

Defines the database driver to use. Currently supports PostgreSQL and SQL Server.

Valid values:
- `postgresql` -> PostgreSQL
- `mssql` -> SQL Server

```yaml
DATASOURCE_DB_DRIVERNAME=postgresql
```

### DATASOURCE_WAKE_DB

Default: `false`

Flag to enable waking of Azure Serverless MSSQL Databases. This will enable a soft retry to wait for the database to wake.

Valid values:
- `true`
- `false`

```yaml
DATASOURCE_WAKE_DB=true
```

## Obfuscation

Two methods of result obfuscation are provided as below. Before building your Hutch tools stack, these can be configured in `compose.yml`.

<ins>Notice</ins>: The method will be applied when its related value is
provided. When both values are provided, the Low Number Suppression will be
applied first, then Rounding.

### Low Number Suppression

There's a data disclosure risk if low numbers are reported for a given query.

Therefore, low number suppression defaults to ON with a value of 10 such that any result with a count below 10 will return 0.

You can override this default by setting the `LOW_NUMBER_SUPPRESSION_THRESHOLD` value. To switch OFF set to 0.
```yaml
LOW_NUMBER_SUPPRESSION_THRESHOLD=#Add your threshold here
```

### Rounding
There's a data disclosure risk if raw results are returned.

Therefore, rounding defaults to ON with a value of 10 such that results are returned to the nearest 10.

You can override the default by setting `ROUNDING_TARGET` and can switch OFF by setting it to 0.

```yaml
ROUNDING_TARGET=#Add your rounding target
```

## Polling

This is set to the number of seconds provided in the environment indicating the polling interval duration.
By default, Bunny will make `GET` request to Task API host every 5 seconds to check for jobs.

```yaml
POLLING_INTERVAL=5
```

## Collection ID

This is the collection ID you would like to query.

```yaml
COLLECTION_ID=collection_id
```

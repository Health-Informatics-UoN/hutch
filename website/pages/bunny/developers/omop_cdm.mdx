# OMOP CDM Setup

Before Bunny can run, it needs an OMOP CDM database to query.

You can find out more about the [OMOP CDM from OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/), and [their guidance](https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/wiki/General-Structure,-Download-and-Use) for creating one.

We have guidance if you need to quickly build one, or have been supplied with a database backup.

    ## Database Setup
    <Steps>

      ### Start the containers

      The `dev.compose.yml` in the root of the Bunny repository can start a Postgres database container, and an init service `omop-lite`.

      [`omop-lite`](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/omop-lite) will load a small synthetic OMOP CDM of 100 people, enough for Bunny to run queries.

      Or you can use it to load your own data files by changing the `dev.compose.yml` file.

      ```bash copy
      docker compose -f dev.compose.yml up db omop-lite
      ```

      ### Configuration

      You can connect to the now running OMOP CDM with the following configuration:

      ```bash copy filename=".env" 
      DATASOURCE_DB_USERNAME=postgres
      DATASOURCE_DB_PASSWORD=postgres
      DATASOURCE_DB_DATABASE=omop
      DATASOURCE_DB_DRIVERNAME=postgresql
      DATASOURCE_DB_SCHEMA=cdm
      DATASOURCE_DB_PORT=5432
      DATASOURCE_DB_HOST=localhost
      ```    
    </Steps>

    ## Database Setup

    <Callout type="info">
      These instructions assume you have a pre-existing OMOP CDM Postgresql database dump
      and it can be called `hutch_db.tar`, for example, as below.
    </Callout>

    <Steps>
    ### Start the database container

    The `dev.compose.yml` in the root of the Bunny repository can start a database container with

    ```bash copy
    docker compose -f dev.compose.yml up db
    ```

    This will initialise a Postgres instance in the container.

    ### Copy the data

    Navigate to the folder containing `hutch_db.tar` and copy it into the container with:

    ```bash copy
    docker cp hutch_db.tar hutch-bunny-dev-db-1:/
    ```

    ### Start running bash in your container

    ```bash copy
    docker exec -it hutch-bunny-dev-db-1 bash
    ```

    ### Use pg_restore to load the data into the database

    ```bash copy
    pg_restore --dbname=postgres --host=localhost --port=5432 --username=postgres --password hutch_db.tar
    ```

    If prompted, provide "postgres" as a password

    You can then exit the container with `ctrl+d` or `exit`

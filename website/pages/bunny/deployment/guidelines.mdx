# Security Guidelines

This document outlines security and infrastructure recommendations for deploying and running Bunny within a network.

## Container Images 

- Bunny should be deployed using container images to ensure consistency and security. 
- Bunny should be regularly updated to the latest stable release.
- Organisations can build their own image from source if required.

## Version Pinning

- Bunny containers should be pinned to a specific tagged version for stability. 
- Using tagged versions ensures that you are deploying a known, tested version of the software, which helps in maintaining a stable and predictable environment. 
- You can find a list of available version tags in the [container registry](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch-bunny/pkgs/container/hutch%2Fbunny).

## Networking

- Bunny should be deployed within a private subnet for isolation from other services.
- Bunny should be secured with network policies to restrict outbound connections to the RQUEST / Relay API.

## Configuration

- Bunny credentials for databases and APIs should be stored in a secrets service.

## Monitoring
- Bunny logs should be forwarded to a centralised logging system.
- Alerts should be set up for failed queries and excessive errors.
- Container health checks and external monitoring should be used to ensure Bunny is running as expected.

## Data Access
- Database credentials used by Bunny should be limited to the minimum required permissions.

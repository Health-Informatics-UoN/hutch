# Security Model

This document outlines the security considerations, infrastructure requirements, and trust model for deploying and running Bunny within a network. 

Information about Cohort Discovery can be found on the [HDR Gateway](https://healthdatagateway.org/en/about/cohort-discovery).

Bunny is compliant with the governance and security model outlined in the [Cohort Discovery Implementation Guide](https://healthdatagateway.org/en/data-custodian/support/cohort-discovery). 

## Container Security

### Image Build Process
- Bunny images are built using GitHub Actions, using a repeatable and transparent build process. 
- Each dependency from the build process is pinned to a git hash.
- This automation helps ensure that each build is consistent and can be traced back to its source code and build instructions.

### Container Registry
- Every Bunny image is published to the GitHub container registry. 
- Images are pinned to specific workflow commit hashes, which prevents unauthorized modifications and ensures that only verified builds are used. 
- This pinning mechanism helps maintain security by ensuring that the exact version of the code that was reviewed and tested is the one being deployed.

### Code Security & Review
- All code contributions must pass a set of unit, integration, and end to end tests. 
- Contributions are reviewed by the University of Nottingham Centre for Health Informatics developer team, before they are approved and merged into the codebase.
- Code scanning using GitHub's CodeQL analysis is enabled on the repository and contributions to automatically identify potential security vulnerabilities and coding issues.
- Bunny has a [security policy](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch-bunny/security) for vulnerability reporting.

### Dependency & Supply Chain Security
- The base image and all dependencies are reviewed for security updates.
- GitHubâ€™s [dependency-review-action](https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action) is used to detect vulnerable dependencies before they are introduced into the codebase.
- Bunny uses Dependabot to automatically scan and update dependencies, ensuring security vulnerabilities are identified and patched promptly.
- Updates are published with release notes on the [Bunny releases page](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch-bunny/releases). 
- A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for Bunny [is published](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch-bunny/network/dependencies) providing visibility into dependencies and supply chain security.

## Infrastructure Security

- Bunny is deployed in a secure environment by a data partner. 
- Bunny requires access to the data partner's OMOP CDM database.
- Bunny makes only outgoing connections to RQUEST / Relay API over HTTPS.
- No incoming requests are made into the data partner's secure environment.
- Outbound access is restricted to the RQUEST / Relay API, no other access is required.

## Authentication & Access Control
- Credentials (database access, RQUEST / Relay authentication) are managed through environment variables.
- Bunny connections to RQUEST / Relay are secured using the 'Basic' HTTP Authentication Scheme, consistent with the API specification.

## Data Security & Compliance
- Bunny executes only validated queries that comply with the RQUEST / Relay specification.
- Bunny cannot execute arbitrary SQL or code.
- Low-number suppression and rounding can be configured to custom values to comply with data protection policies.
- Bunny can be configured to log externally the API requests, payloads, queries, SQL executed, results, and errors for audit purposes.
- Bunny does not persist data to a database.

# Security Documentation

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the security considerations, infrastructure requirements, and trust model for deploying and running Bunny within an network. 
It provides clarity on the container images used, connectivity concerns, and best practices for deployment.

Bunny is deployed in your environment and requires infrastructure access to your OMOP CDM database, using username/password authentication.
Bunny runs as a containerised service and can be deployed within a private subnet for isolation.
To connect to RQUEST, two Bunny containers are required.

Outbound-only traffic:
Bunny makes only outgoing requests over HTTPS (port 443).
Outbound access is restricted to the RQUEST API (it does not require open internet access).
No incoming requests are required into your environment.

Data security: Bunny executes only pre-validated queries, meaning no arbitrary SQL can be run.
Obfuscation support: Configurable low-number suppression and rounding help safeguard sensitive data.
Authentication: Requests to RQUEST are secured using Basic Auth, as per RQUEST API requirements.
Secrets management: All credentials (database, RQUEST auth) are managed through environment variables and can be stored in a secrets service (for example Azure Key Vault).

|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| CPU                 | 2 vCPUs                                                     |
| Memory (RAM)        | 4 GB                                                        |
| Container Runtime   | OCI-compliant container runtime (Docker, Podman, Kubernetes)|
| Network             | Outbound HTTPS (port 443)                                   |
| Database Access     | OMOP CDM PostgreSQL / SQL Server                             |

- Any operating system that supports running containers is sufficient.
- Requirements may vary depending on workload and deployment environment.

## Supported Database Versions

Bunny supports the following database versions for OMOP CDM:

| Database Type | Supported Versions |
|---------------|-------------------|
| PostgreSQL    | 14, 15, 16, 17   |
| SQL Server    | 2019, 2022        |

## OMOP CDM

Bunny requires an [OMOP CDM](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/background.html) database to query for data.

Bunny supports OMOP CDM 5.3 and 5.4, as the [differences](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54Changes.html) between the two are not relevant. 

Ideally the database should comply with the common data model, and the minimum data model that Bunny requires is slightly different than the [HDR Gateway](https://healthdatagateway.org/en/data-custodian/support/cohort-discovery). 

Recommended tables and field names:

| OMOP Table            | OMOP Field Names                                                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Person                 | person_id, gender_concept_id, year_of_birth, race_concept_id, **ethnicity_concept_id*** |
| **Concept***           | **concept_id***, **domain_id***                                                         |
| Condition Occurrence   | condition_occurrence_id, person_id, condition_concept_id, condition_start_date          |
| Drug Exposure          | drug_exposure_id, person_id, drug_concept_id, drug_exposure_start_date                  |
| Observation            | observation_id, person_id, observation_concept_id, observation_date                     |
| Measurement            | measurement_id, person_id, measurement_concept_id, measurement_date                     |

_*Not included in the HDR Gateway minimum data model._

The following indexes are also recommended from the CDM to ensure queries are processed quickly.

| OMOP Table             | Recommended Indexes                |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Person                 | idx_person_id                      |
| Concept                | idx_concept_concept_id             |
| Condition Occurrence   | idx_condition_concept_id_1         |
| Observation            | idx_observation_concept_id_1       |
| Measurement            | idx_measurement_concept_id_1       |

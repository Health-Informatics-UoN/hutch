# How to Update Bunny

These instructions cover updating Bunny when using [Docker Compose](/bunny/deployment), which is the simplest way to deploy. If you're managing Bunny with a more advanced setup (for example Kubernetes, Ansible, or a custom orchestration tool), you likely already have your own update process in place.

## 1. Check Available Versions
Each container image is tagged with a version number upon release. You can find a list of available versions in the [container registry](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch-bunny/pkgs/container/hutch%2Fbunny).

## 2. Update Your `docker-compose.yml`
Edit your `docker-compose.yml` file to use the new version tag. For example:

```
services:
  bunny:
    image: ghcr.io/health-informatics-uon/hutch/bunny:NEW_VERSION
```
Replace NEW_VERSION with the latest version tag from the registry. You can use git hashes or timestamps, but we strongly recommend version numbers as tags.

For example, for version `1.0.0-alpha.2`:

`image: ghcr.io/health-informatics-uon/hutch/bunny:1.0.0-alpha.2`

## 3. Apply the Update
Run the following commands to update your deployment:
```
docker-compose pull  # Fetch the updated image
docker-compose up -d --remove-orphans  # Restart with the new version
docker image prune -f  # (Optional) Remove old images to free space
```

## 4. Verify the Update
Check that Bunny is running correctly by viewing the logs:

docker-compose logs -f bunny
If needed, restart it manually with:

`docker-compose restart bunny`

## 5. Roll Back If Needed
If something goes wrong, you can roll back to a previous version:

Edit `docker-compose.yml` to specify an older version tag, and follow step 3.

This ensures you can revert to a stable version if necessary.

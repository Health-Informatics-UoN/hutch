# Quickstart

The easiest way to run Bunny is by using the provided [Bunny Image](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch-bunny/pkgs/container/hutch%2Fbunny) command line interface to query an OMOP CDM database, without needing an upstream Task API.

This guide will help you quickly set up a local OMOP CDM database and run a query against it.

## Prerequisites

- Docker

## Run a query

<Steps>
### Get the Demo Compose file

Download the [sample Bunny Demo Compose](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch/refs/heads/main/samples/Bunny/bunny-demo.compose.yml) file by running the command:

```bash copy
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch/refs/heads/main/samples/Bunny/bunny-demo.compose.yml
```

Or manually saving it to a file `bunny-demo.compose.yml`

### Run the Compose file

This will start the database, initialise it with a synthetic OMOP CDM dataset, and run a query against it.

```bash copy
docker compose -f bunny-demo.compose.yml run bunny bunny --body tests/queries/availability.json
```

This will take a minute or so to download the images and start the containers.

The query file is a JSON file that contains the query to run, which is a simple cohort definition, querying the `Person` table for `8507`.

```json copy filename="availability.json"
{
  "task_id": "job-2023-01-13-14: 20: 38-project",
  "project": "project_id",
  "owner": "user1",
  "cohort": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "rules": [
          {
            "varname": "OMOP",
            "varcat": "Person",
            "type": "TEXT",
            "oper": "=",
            "value": "8507"
          }
        ],
        "rules_oper": "AND"
      }
    ],
    "groups_oper": "OR"
  },
  "collection": "collection_id",
  "protocol_version": "v2",
  "char_salt": "salt",
  "uuid": "unique_id"
}
```

### View the results

You should see output like the following:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "protocolVersion": "v2",
  "uuid": "unique_id",
  "queryResult": {
    "count": 40,
    "datasetCount": 0,
    "files": []
  },
  "message": "",
  "collection_id": "collection_id"
}
```

That contains the **results** of the query, which was 44. 

### Clean up

```bash copy
docker compose -f bunny-demo.compose.yml down
```

This will stop the database and remove the containers.

To remove the images, run:

```bash copy
docker rmi -f ghcr.io/health-informatics-uon/omop-lite:latest ghcr.io/health-informatics-uon/hutch/bunny:edge
```

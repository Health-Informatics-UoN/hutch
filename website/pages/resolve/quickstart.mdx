# Getting started with Resolve

This page will guide you through getting Resolve running locally.

Start by cloning [the Hutch tools repository](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch-cohort-discovery)

## Prerequisites
- Resolve runs on Python 3.9
- Dependencies are managed with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), which needs to be installed if you run Resolve outside a container.
- Resolve needs to query a database
  - A remote OMOP-CDM database running
  - Or a tarball containing a `pg_dump` of an OMOP-CDM database

## OMOP-CDM setup
Before Resolve can get up and running, it needs a database to query.
If you don't have a real OMOP-CDM, you can run a mock database.

### Mock database setup
<Steps>
#### Start a containerized database

The `compose.yml` in the root of the Hutch tools repository can start a database container with

```bash
docker compose up db
```

This will initialise a Postgres instance in the container.

<Callout type="info" >
These instructions assume you have a dump of an OMOP-CDM database called `hutch_db.tar`
</Callout>

#### Copy the data

Navigate to the folder containing `hutch_db.tar` and copy it into the container with:

```bash
docker cp hutch_db.tar hutch-resolve-dev-db-1:/
```

#### Start running bash in your container
```bash
docker exec -it hutch-resolve-dev-db-1 bash
```

#### Use pg_restore to load the data into the database

```bash
pg_restore --dbname=postgres --host=localhost --port=5432 --username=postgres --password hutch_db.tar
```

You may be asked to set a password.
The rest of the quickstart assumes you use 'postgres'

You can then exit the container with `ctrl+d` or `exit`
</Steps>

## Environment configuration
To run resolve locally, your environment needs to have some variables configured.
For example, if using the containerized mock database:

```sh copy
DATASOURCE_DB_USERNAME=postgres
DATASOURCE_DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DATASOURCE_DB_DATABASE=postgres
DATASOURCE_DB_DRIVERNAME=postgresql
DATASOURCE_DB_SCHEMA=public
DATASOURCE_DB_PORT=5432
DATASOURCE_DB_HOST=localhost
TASK_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
TASK_API_USERNAME=username
TASK_API_PASSWORD=password
LOW_NUMBER_SUPPRESSION_THRESHOLD=
ROUNDING_TARGET=
POLLING_INTERVAL=5
```

If you are querying a remote database, the variables prefixed with `DATASOURCE` must be configured accordingly.

There are various ways to load environment variables, but a convenient way for this purpose is to use a plugin for poetry that loads environment variables from a .env file.
<Steps>
### Create a file called .env in app/resolve
For a template, copy the variables described above

### Add the plugin

```bash
poetry add self poetry-plugin-dotenv
```
</Steps>
## Installing dependencies
The first time you run Resolve outside a container, you will need to install its dependencies by running
```bash
poetry install
```
in `app/resolve`

## Running the Docker daemon

Resolve has a daemon which polls [Relay](/relay) for jobs, so needs to have a Relay instance running.

<Steps>
### Start the Relay container

The compose used to start up the database also contains an implementation of Relay.

```bash
docker compose up relay -d
```

### Run the Resolve daemon

The Resolve daemon can then be run using poetry. This will ensure the dependencies and environment variables are loaded

```bash
poetry run resolve-daemon
```

You should then see a message in your console like this:

```bash
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:24 - Setting up database connection...
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:24 - Looking for job...
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:29 - Job received. Resolving...
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:29 - Processing query...
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:30 - Solved availability query
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:30 - Job resolved.
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:35 - Looking for job...
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:40 - Looking for job...
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:45 - Looking for job...
```

Resolve establishes a connection to your OMOP-CDM database, then polls Relay for a job.
When it receives a job, it processes the query, queries the database, and sends the result back to Relay.
You won't see the results here, but if you see the messages, then it's successfully contacting both the database and Relay.

</Steps>

Congratulations on your first Resolve query!
</Callout>


## Running resolve-cli

To run Resolve without Relay, the command-line interface can be used.
This needs a file with the right JSON schema to run.

An example is:

```json
{ "task_id" : "job-2023-01-13-14: 20: 38-project",
"project" : "project_id", "owner" : "user1","cohort" : { "groups" : [
            { "rules" : [
                    { "varname" : "OMOP", "varcat": "Person", "type" : "TEXT", "oper" : "=", "value" : "8507"
                    }
                ],"rules_oper" : "AND"
            }
        ], "groups_oper" : "OR"
    }, "collection" : "collection_id","protocol_version" : "v2", "char_salt" : "salt","uuid" : "unique_id"
}
```

To run the CLI, navigate to `hutch-cohort-discovery/app/resolve`

Then run

```bash
poetry run resolve-cli --body <path/to/rquest-query.json>
```

This should write a result for your query to `app/resolve/output.json`

# Resolve Deployment

This page will guide you through getting Resolve deployed in a Virtual Machine (VM).

## Prerequisites

- A VM with these apps installed
  - [Docker](https://knowledgebase.aridhia.io/workspaces/analysing-data/virtual-machines/installing-software-on-virtual-machines/installing-docker-on-your-virtual-machine) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  - [wget](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wget-command-with-examples#:~:text=wget%20is%20a%20free%20GNU,this%20tutorial%20uses%20Ubuntu%2022.04)
- A OMOP CDM database server up and running

## Deployment Steps

### Get the example Compose file

Download the example of Resolve's Compose file by running the command:

```bash copy
wget https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch/blob/main/samples/Bunny/compose.resolve.yml
```

### Environment configuration

Modify the configuration of the newly downloaded `compose.resolve.yml` file as described in [Configuring Resolve](/resolve/config)

You will need to [configure the database connection](/resolve/config#database), and your [Task API host connection](/resolve/config#task)

## Running Resolve

At the directory containing the `compose.resolve.yml` file, run the command to activate Resolve:

```bash copy
docker compose up
```

You should then see a message in your console like this:

```bash
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:24 - Setting up database connection...
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:24 - Looking for job...
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:29 - Job received. Resolving...
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:29 - Processing query...
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:30 - Solved availability query
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:30 - Job resolved.
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:35 - Looking for job...
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:40 - Looking for job...
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:45 - Looking for job...
```

Resolve establishes a connection to your OMOP-CDM database, then polls the Task API Host for a job.
When it receives a job, it processes the query, queries the database, and sends the result back to Task API Host.
You won't see the results here, but if you see the messages, then it's successfully contacting both the database and Task API Host.

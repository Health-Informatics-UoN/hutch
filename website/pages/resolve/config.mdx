# Configuration

Resolve can be configured using environment variables.
If you're running Resolve as part of a composed stack of containers, these are set in the `compose.yml`.
They can be found under

```yaml
services:
  # other containers, if needed
  resolve:
    depends_on:
      - db
      - relay
      - rabbitmq
    image: resolve
    build:
      context: app/resolve
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.daemon
    environment:
      - DATASOURCE_DB_USERNAME=postgres
      - DATASOURCE_DB_PASSWORD=postgres
      - DATASOURCE_DB_DATABASE=postgres
      - DATASOURCE_DB_DRIVERNAME=postgresql
      - DATASOURCE_DB_SCHEMA=public
      - DATASOURCE_DB_PORT=5432
      - DATASOURCE_DB_HOST=db
      - TASK_API_BASE_URL=http://relay:8080
      - TASK_API_USERNAME=username
      - TASK_API_PASSWORD=password
      - LOW_NUMBER_SUPPRESSION_THRESHOLD=
      - ROUNDING_TARGET=
      - POLLING_INTERVAL=5
      - COLLECTION_ID=collection_id
```

In development, if you're running Resolve outside a container, you can instead set these with a `.env` file, as described in [quickstart](/resolve/quickstart).

## Task API [#task]

```yaml
TASK_API_BASE_URL=<host>:<port>
TASK_API_USERNAME=<Task API username>
TASK_API_PASSWORD=<Task API password>
```

### Relay as Task API host

To configure the resolve-daemon communicating with Relay, the `TASK_API` variables must be set.
When configuring [Relay](/relay) {/* when there's a relay configuration page, link there */}, you will set a port to poll for jobs, a username and a password.

- If Resolve and Relay are running in the same stack, the host should be `http://relay`.
- If you have Relay running locally, and Resolve running locally, the host should be `http://localhost`
- If you are not using Relay as Task API host, see below

### Other Task API hosts

- You need to change the `TASK_API_BASE_URL` value according to your actual Task API host where Resolve connected to `GET` the job and `POST` the results back.
- The I/O requests from Resolve are authenticated by the `TASK_API_USERNAME` and `TASK_API_PASSWORD`, please put your Task API credentials here

### Job Type

- If you would like Resolve to connect directly with Rquest, you have to add one more configuration which is `TASK_API_TYPE`. This can only be either `a` (Availability), `b` (Distribution and PHEWAS) or `c` (AnalyticsGwas, AnalyticsGwasQuantitiveTrait, AnalyticsBurdenTest).

## Database [#database]

The database connection is configured by the variables prefixed with `DATASOURCE_DB`

```
DATASOURCE_DB_USERNAME=<username>
DATASOURCE_DB_PASSWORD=<password>
DATASOURCE_DB_DATABASE=<database name - ignored if using Trino>
DATASOURCE_DB_DRIVERNAME=<driver name - ignored if using Trino>
DATASOURCE_DB_SCHEMA=<database schema name>
DATASOURCE_DB_PORT=<port served by database>
DATASOURCE_DB_HOST=<database host>
USE_TRINO=
```

If using the supplied `compose.yml` and running the database in the same stack, unless you modify the database configuration, the defaults will connect Resolve to your database.
If using a remote database, change accordingly.

## Obfuscation

Two methods of result obfuscation are providedas below. Before building your Hutch tools stack, these can be configured in `compose.yml`.

<ins>Notice</ins>: The method will be applied when its related value is
provided. When both values are provided, the Low Number Suppression will be
applied first, then Rounding.

### Low Number Suppression

There's a data disclosure risk if low numbers are reported for a given query, so if the `LOW_NUMBER_SUPPRESSION_THRESHOLD` is provided, low number suppression will be applied to results, such that any result with a count below a given threshold will not be revealed.

```yaml
LOW_NUMBER_SUPPRESSION_THRESHOLD=#Add your threshold here
```

### Rounding

If the `ROUNDING_TARGET` is provided, results can be rounded to the nearest _n_

```yaml
ROUNDING_TARGET=#Add your rounding target
```

## Polling

This is set to the number of seconds provided in the environment indicating the polling interval duration.
By default, Resolve will make `GET` request to Task API host every 5 seconds to check for jobs.

```yaml
POLLING_INTERVAL=5
```

## Collection ID

This is the collection ID you would like to query.

```yaml
COLLECTION_ID=collection_id
```

# Distribution Task

## Purpose

A Distribution Task is a standardised request asking for summary statistics of the OMOP dataset, they will run nightly on a dataset.

The task includes metadata such as the collection ID, and task ID, along with the type (`analysis`) to be run. 

It helps populate the user interface of RQUEST, enabling a researcher to build their query on the data that exists.

Upon retrieving the task, Bunny securely queries the OMOP dataset within the Data Custodianâ€™s environment. 
The result is a list summary statistics of the dataset, subject to [disclosure controls](/concepts/disclosure_controls). 

No raw or identifiable data leaves the system; only summary statistics are returned.

## Example Input Schema

<Tabs items={["JSON", "SQL" ]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  An example Distribution task:

    ```json
    {
      "code": "DEMOGRAPHICS",
      "analysis": "DISTRIBUTION",
      "uuid": "unique_id",
      "collection": "collection_id",
      "owner": "user_id"
    }
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    This is the SQL executed by Bunny in response to the task.

    - Counts the number of distinct persons associated with each OMOP concept across several domains: conditions, drugs, measurements, observations, procedures, gender, race, and ethnicity.
	  - Joins each domain table with the OMOP concept table to retrieve the human-readable concept name (concept_name) alongside the concept ID.
	  - Groups results by concept to produce per-concept summaries of how many unique individuals have data for that concept.
	  
    Disclosure control:
	  - The count is rounded to the nearest 10 for disclosure control `(ROUND(count / 10) * 10)`.
	  - The result is only returned if at least 10 people meet the criteria `(HAVING Count(*) >= 10)`.

    ```sql

## Response Schema

Bunny returns a structured JSON response upon completing a Distribution task. 

The key field is the `queryResult.files.file_data`, a base64 encoded summary statistics file. 

The `queryResult.count` field describes the number of rows in the file.

```json

  "status": "ok",
  "protocolVersion": "v2",
  "uuid": "unique_id",

      }
    ]
  },
  "message": "",
  "collection_id": "collection_id"

```

The decoded `file_data` will contain summary statistics:

```tsv
BIOBANK	CODE	COUNT	DESCRIPTION	MIN	Q1	MEDIAN	MEAN	Q3	MAX	ALTERNATIVES	DATASET	OMOP	OMOP_DESCR	CATEGORY
collection_id	OMOP:4323688	20										4323688	Cough at rest	Condition
collection_id	OMOP:35626061	10										35626061	No cough strength	Condition
collection_id	OMOP:38003563	60										38003563	Hispanic or Latino	Ethnicity
collection_id	OMOP:38003564	40										38003564	Not Hispanic or Latino	Ethnicity
collection_id	OMOP:8507	40										8507	MALE	Gender
collection_id	OMOP:8532	60										8532	FEMALE	Gender
collection_id	OMOP:21490742	10										21490742	Airway resistance --during inspiration	Measurement
collection_id	OMOP:4266009	10										4266009	Ability to smell	Observation
```

Each row summarises the frequency and distribution of a particular OMOP concept (e.g., a condition, gender, ethnicity, observation, or measurement).

For example, FEMALE (concept ID: 8532) appears 60 times, and the Observation Ability to smell (concept ID: 4266009) appears 10 times.

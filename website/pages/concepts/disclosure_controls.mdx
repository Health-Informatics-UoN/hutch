# Disclosure Controls

[Bunny](/bunny) and [Relay](/relay) support Cohort Discovery with built-in, automated disclosure controls, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected at all times.

Data Custodians retain full control over their data - Cohort Discovery never exposes individual-level information. Instead, it allows researchers to pose queries that return only aggregate counts of people matching specific criteria within a dataset.

To protect privacy and reduce the risk of re-identification:
- You can configure a minimum threshold (commonly 10) below which no result is returned.
- You can enable automatic rounding of results to prevent precise counts from being used to infer sensitive details. For example, returning “110” instead of “102”.

These controls are applied automatically, activated by default, and are configurable, allowing a Data Custodian to safely participate in Cohort Discovery while meeting their data governance and privacy obligations.

Both [Bunny](/bunny/config#obfuscation) and [Relay](/relay/config#results-obfuscation) can configure levels of disclosure control, to enable information governance policy. 

Before new versions of Bunny and Relay are released, our test framework ensures that the disclosure controls are correctly applied and cannot be bypassed.

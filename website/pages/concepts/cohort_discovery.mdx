Cohort Discovery, originally developed as part of the CO-CONNECT programme, supported researchers to find and access COVID-19 data at pace, while ensuring peoples information was kept private and secure. 
If you would like to learn more about the CO-CONNECT development for the rapid discovery and data access to COVID-19 data, please read the [CO-CONNECT Hybrid Architecture paper](https://www.jmir.org/2022/12/e40035).

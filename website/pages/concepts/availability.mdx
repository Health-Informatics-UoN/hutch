# Availability Task

## Purpose

An Availability Task is a standardised request asking for a count of individuals matching a defined cohort specification. 
The task includes metadata such as the collection ID, and task ID, along with the cohort definition expressed as structured rules.

Upon retrieving the task, Bunny securely queries the pseudonymised OMOP dataset within the Data Custodian’s environment. 
The result is a numerical count of matching records, subject to [disclosure controls](/concepts/disclosure_controls). 

No raw or identifiable data leaves the system; only the count is returned.

## Example Input Schema

<Tabs items={["JSON", "SQL" ]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  An example Availability task:

  This task instructs Bunny to query the OMOP `condition_occurrence` table for individuals who have a recorded condition concept ID equal to `4323688`, which represents a specific clinical condition ("Cough at rest"). 
  The "time" field specifies a temporal constraint:
  
  `1|:TIME:M` indicates the condition must have occurred at least one month ago (i.e. the record’s start date is at least one month before the time of query execution).

  Only individuals with at least one such condition occurrence meeting this time constraint will match this rule.

    ```json
    {
      "task_id" : "job-2025-02-14-09:03:27-RQ-87808b58-b878-4b59-839f-3537727c64a6",
      "project" : "project_id",
      "owner" : "user1",
      "cohort" : {
        "groups": [
          {
            "rules": [
              {
                "varname": "OMOP",
                "varcat": "Condition",
                "type": "TEXT",
                "oper": "=",
                "value": "4323688",
                "time": "1|:TIME:M"
              }
            ],
            "rules_oper": "OR"
          }
        ],
        "groups_oper": "AND"
      },
      "collection": "collection_id",
      "protocol_version" : "v2",
      "char_salt" : "salt",
      "uuid" : "9541374b-8b97-41a4-9717-4a2a25f437ae"
    }
    ```

    This is the SQL executed by Bunny in response to the task.

    It calculates an anonymised count of individuals who have a record matching a specific concept ID (`4323688`) in any of the four core OMOP tables: measurement, observation, condition_occurrence, or drug_exposure, with the relevant event date occurring on or before '2025-04-08 21:05:24.471729'.
	  - Subqueries: Each EXISTS clause checks whether a person has at least one matching record in the respective table.
	  - Time Filter: Ensures only records older than the specified date are considered.
	  - OR Logic: A person is included if they match any one of the four conditions.
	  - Outer Query: Counts the number of distinct matching person_ids from the person table.
	  
    Rounding and Threshold:
	  - The count is rounded to the nearest 10 for disclosure control `(ROUND(count / 10) * 10)`.
	  - The result is only returned if at least 10 people meet the criteria `(HAVING Count(*) >= 10)`.

    ```sql
    SELECT Round(Count(*) / Cast(10 AS NUMERIC), 0) * 10 AS anon_1
    FROM person
    WHERE person.person_id IN
        (SELECT person.person_id
        FROM person
        WHERE (EXISTS
                  (SELECT measurement.person_id
                  FROM measurement
                  WHERE measurement.measurement_concept_id = 4323688
                    AND measurement.measurement_date <= '2025-04-08 21:05:24.471729'
                    AND measurement.person_id = person.person_id))
          OR (EXISTS
                (SELECT observation.person_id
                  FROM observation
                  WHERE observation.observation_concept_id = 4323688
                    AND observation.observation_date <= '2025-04-08 21:05:24.471729'
                    AND observation.person_id = person.person_id))
          OR (EXISTS
                (SELECT condition_occurrence.person_id
                  FROM condition_occurrence
                  WHERE condition_occurrence.condition_concept_id = 4323688
                    AND condition_occurrence.condition_start_date <= '2025-04-08 21:05:24.471729'
                    AND condition_occurrence.person_id = person.person_id))
          OR (EXISTS
                (SELECT drug_exposure.person_id
                  FROM drug_exposure
                  WHERE drug_exposure.drug_concept_id = 4323688
                    AND drug_exposure.drug_exposure_start_date <= '2025-04-08 21:05:24.471729'
                    AND drug_exposure.person_id = person.person_id)))
    HAVING Count(*) >= 10
    ```

## Response Schema

Bunny returns a structured JSON response upon completing an Availability Query. 

The key field is the `queryResult.count`, the number of individuals in the dataset who met the specified criteria. 

```

  "status": "ok",
  "protocolVersion": "v2",
  "uuid": "9541374b-8b97-41a4-9717-4a2a25f437ae",

    "count": 1,
    "datasetCount": 0,
    "files": []

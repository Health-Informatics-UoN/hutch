# Relay Deployment

This page will guide you through getting Relay deployed in a Virtual Machine (VM).

<Callout emoji="🐇">
  We provide a [container
  registry](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch-bunny/pkgs/container/hutch%2Frelay)
  for ease of deployment.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- A VM with these apps installed
  - [Docker](https://knowledgebase.aridhia.io/workspaces/analysing-data/virtual-machines/installing-software-on-virtual-machines/installing-docker-on-your-virtual-machine) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  - [wget](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wget-command-with-examples#:~:text=wget%20is%20a%20free%20GNU,this%20tutorial%20uses%20Ubuntu%2022.04)
- A PostgreSQL 16+ Database Server accessible from the VM

## Deployment Steps

### Get the example Compose file

Download the [sample Relay Compose](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch/refs/heads/main/samples/Bunny/compose/relay.compose.yml) file by running the command:

```bash copy
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch/refs/heads/main/samples/Bunny/compose/relay.compose.yml
```

### Environment configuration

Modify the configuration of the newly downloaded `relay.compose.yml` file as described in [Configuring Relay](/relay/config)

You will need to [configure the database connection](/relay/config#database).

The sample has Relay's GA4GH Beacon interface enabled.

If you want to use Relay with an Upstream Task API Query Srouce, you'll need to configure your [Upstream Task API host connection](/relay/config#upstream-task-api).

#### Database Migrations

You can choose to run migrations for Relay's Database either on demand (via the CLI, e.g. in a CI/CD process) or automatically (on startup of the Web App).

If you are working from source, you may wish to use the developer tooling.

<Tabs items={["Automatically", "Relay CLI", "Developer tooling"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  You can opt into this behaviour with the `ApplyMigrationsOnStartup` flag in Relay's [Database Config](/relay/config#database).
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  You can run migrations on demand from the Relay CLI, using the [`database update` command](/relay/cli/database#update).

  Here's an example of running migrations, using the compose configuration:

  ```bash copy
  docker compose run relay database update
  ```

  <Callout>
  We've used `docker run` to ensure we run the same version of Relay for the CLI as is running in our Compose stack.
  </Callout>
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
  When working from source, you should use the Entity Framework Core tooling to run migrations (and otherwise manage them) as normal.

  1. `dotnet tool restore` in the root of the Relay repository to restore the correct version of the tooling locally
  2. `dotnet ef database update` (or any other `dotnet-ef` commands as desired)
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

#### User and Sub Node setup

Relay's job is to relay tasks from an upstream Task Api to one or more downstream "Sub Nodes".

Each Sub Node requires a set of credentials (in effect a user) to communicate with Relay, and Relay requires at minimum one user and subnode to be configured.

The sample Compose file [declaratively preconfigures](/relay/config#declarative-subnodes) one user and subnode, but you can also perform this setup imperatively via the [CLI](/relay/cli/users#add).

#### Sub Node Bunny setup

For a Sub Node's Bunny to talk to Relay, it will need to be [configured](/bunny/config) with:

- The base URL to your Relay instance (scheme, hostname and port)
- The username and password created for the Bunny
- The Sub Node ID (Collection ID) created for that user

The Sample Compose file specifies the following declarative user and subnode configuration:

| | |
|-|-|
Username | `username`
Password | `password`
Sub Node ID | `93258ae6-472f-45d2-8cf9-8b64cbeb03c8`

<Callout type="warning">
  Remember, Bunny will need network access to Relay (outbound from Bunny;
  inbound to Relay, on whatever ports Relay is configured to listen on).
</Callout>

## Running Relay

At the directory containing the `relay.compose.yml` file, run the command to activate Relay:

```bash copy
docker compose up
```

You should then see a message in your console like this:

```bash
relay-1     | info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
relay-1     |       Now listening on: http://[::]:8080
relay-1     | info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
relay-1     |       Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
relay-1     | info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
relay-1     |       Hosting environment: Production
relay-1     | info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
relay-1     |       Content root path: /app
```

### Submitting Queries

<Tabs items={["GA4GH Beacon", "Upstream Task API"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  Sending an HTTP Request to a Beacon endpoint, such as <dfn title="/ga4gh/beacon/v2/filtering_terms">Filtering Terms</dfn> or <dfn title="/ga4gh/beacon/v2/individuals">Individuals</dfn> will cause Relay to enqueue a task for each configured downstream SubNode.
  When results have been received from all SubNodes, Relay returns the aggregated results as the HTTP Response.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  Relay establishes a connection to your Upstream Task API server, then polls for a task.
  When it receives a task, it enqueues it for each configured downstream SubNode.
  When results have been received from all SubNodes, Relay passes the aggregated results back to the Upstream Task API.
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

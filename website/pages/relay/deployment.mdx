# Relay Deployment

This page will guide you through getting Relay deployed in a Virtual Machine (VM).

## Prerequisites

- A VM with these apps installed
  - [Docker](https://knowledgebase.aridhia.io/workspaces/analysing-data/virtual-machines/installing-software-on-virtual-machines/installing-docker-on-your-virtual-machine) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  - [wget](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wget-command-with-examples#:~:text=wget%20is%20a%20free%20GNU,this%20tutorial%20uses%20Ubuntu%2022.04)
- A PostgreSQL 16+ Database Server accessible from the VM

## Deployment Steps

### Get the example Compose file

Download the [sample Relay Compose](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch/refs/heads/main/samples/Bunny/relay.compose.yml) file by running the command:

```bash copy
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch/refs/heads/main/samples/Bunny/relay.compose.yml
```

### Environment configuration

Modify the configuration of the newly downloaded `relay.compose.yml` file as described in [Configuring Relay](/relay/config)

You will need to [configure the database connection](/relay/config#database), and your [Upstream Task API host connection](/relay/config#upstream-task-api)

#### Database Migrations

Currently the preferred way to run migrations is to have Relay do it automatically at startup.

You can opt into this behaviour with the `ApplyMigrationsOnStartup` flag in Relay's [Database Config](/relay/config#database).

Alternatively you can use the `dotnet-ef` tooling to run Migrations from Relay's source.

#### User and Sub Node setup

Relay's job is to relay tasks from an upstream Task Api to one or more downstream "Sub Nodes".

Each Sub Node requires a set of credentials (in effect a user) to communicate with Relay.

You can [add a user](/relay/cli/users#add) using [Relay's CLI](/relay/cli), and when you do, Relay will create an associated Sub Node, and generate a password.

The CLI will return the generated password and Sub Node Collection ID.

Here's an example of adding a Relay User, when the database is running locally on the docker host machine:

```bash copy
docker run \
--network=host \
-e ConnectionStrings__Default="Server=localhost;Port=5432;Database=hutch-relay;User Id=postgres;Password=postgres" \
ghcr.io/health-informatics-uon/hutch/relay:dev-latest \
users add demo1
```

<Callout>
We've used `docker run` to ensure we run the same version of Relay for the CLI as is running in our Compose stack.
</Callout>

#### Sub Node Bunny setup

For a Sub Node's Bunny to talk to Relay, you (or someone else) will need to configure it with:

- The base URL to your Relay instance (scheme, hostname and port)
- The username and password created for them
- The Sub Node ID (Collection ID) created for that user

<Callout type="warning">
Remember, Bunny will need network access to Relay (outbound from Bunny; inbound to Relay, on whatever ports Relay is configured to listen on).
</Callout>

## Running Relay

At the directory containing the `relay.compose.yml` file, run the command to activate Relay:

```bash copy
docker compose up
```

You should then see a message in your console like this:

```bash
relay-1     | info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
relay-1     |       Now listening on: http://[::]:8080
relay-1     | info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
relay-1     |       Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
relay-1     | info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
relay-1     |       Hosting environment: Production
relay-1     | info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
relay-1     |       Content root path: /app
```

Relay establishes a connection to your upstream Task API server, then polls for a task.
When it receives a task, it enqueues it for each configured downstream SubNode.
When results have been received from all SubNodes, Relay passes the aggregated results back to the upstream Task API.

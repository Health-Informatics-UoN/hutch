# Global Options

There are some options which can always be passed to the CLI, because they apply to all (or almost all) commands.

Commands will use them as relevant.

## `--environment`
 
Overrides the **Application Environment**.

### Aliases

- `--environment`
- `-e`

### Effects

The **Application Environment** can affect various things about how the app behaves.

The app will attempt to load configuration values from `appsettings.<Environment>.json` if it exists.

<Callout emoji="🧑🏾‍💻">
The `Development` environment opts the app into certain additional behaviours:

- .NET User Secrets will be loaded if present
- Sometimes additional logging or exception behaviours are enabled in Development environments.
</Callout>

### Default value

The default value may be affected by how the app is run.

It is read by default from the environment variable `DOTNET__Environment`.

If no value is provided by Environment Variables, then the following defaults apply:

<Tabs items={["Binary (.NET, Native)", "From Source (IDE, `dotnet run`)" ]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    
Running from a binary (native executable or the `dotnet` runtime, e.g. `dotnet Hutch.Relay.dll`) will use the value `Production`.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>
    - Running from source with `dotnet run` will use the value `Development` unless overridden in `launchsettings.json`.
    - Running from an IDE will use the value `Development` unless overridden in `launchsettings.json`
  </Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

### Usage examples

`--environment <VALUE>`

- `--environment Testing`
  - will set the Environment Name to `Testing`.
  - Development behaviours will not be used
  - User Secrets will not be loaded.
  - If an `appsettings.Testing.json` file is present, configuration will be loaded from it

## `--connection-string`
 
Overrides the Connection String for the Relay Database.

This takes precedence over any value read from any other configuration source.

### Usage examples

`--connection-string <VALUE>`

- `dotnet run -- <COMMAND> --connection-string Server=Testing`
    - Ordinarily `dotnet run` uses the `Development Environment` and therefore will read the default Connection String from:
        - `appsettings.Development.json` first
        - Environment Variables (including the launch profile in `launchsettings.json`)
        - .NET User Secrets, if set
    - but the `--connection-string` option instead overrides the Connection String value with the one specified on the command line.

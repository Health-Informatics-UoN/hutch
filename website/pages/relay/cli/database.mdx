# `database`

<Callout>
All `database` commands require a connection to a Relay database.

This must be [configured](/relay/config#database) when running these commands.

</Callout>

## `update`

Update the Relay Database to the latest migration.

This command uses the Relay binary to run database migrations on the configured Relay Database.

<Callout type="warning">
This command will only update the database structure to the latest migration for this release.

More complicated migration scenarios (such as rollbacks to specific versions) should be performed with the Entity Framework Core tooling.

It is expected the Production need for this will be extremely rare.

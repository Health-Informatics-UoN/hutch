# Set up a Developer Environment

This page will guide you through getting a Bunny developer environment locally.

To make development easy as possible, we recommend using Docker to run the OMOP CDM database, and a uv Python environment to run Bunny.

Start by cloning [the Bunny repository](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch-bunny)

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/hutch-bunny
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- An [OMOP CDM](omop_cdm) database
- Upstream Task API ([Relay](/relay) or RQUEST) (optional)

## Steps
<Steps>
### Environment configuration

To run Bunny locally, your environment needs to have variables configured.

Create a `.env` file in the repository root.

The file should contain the variables required to connect to a database and Task API.

For example, if using a local Relay and local database:

```sh copy
DATASOURCE_DB_USERNAME=postgres
DATASOURCE_DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DATASOURCE_DB_DATABASE=postgres
DATASOURCE_DB_DRIVERNAME=postgresql
DATASOURCE_DB_SCHEMA=public
DATASOURCE_DB_PORT=5432
DATASOURCE_DB_HOST=localhost
TASK_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
TASK_API_USERNAME=username
TASK_API_PASSWORD=password
LOW_NUMBER_SUPPRESSION_THRESHOLD=
ROUNDING_TARGET=
POLLING_INTERVAL=5
BUNNY_LOGGER_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

- If you are querying a remote database, the variables prefixed with `DATASOURCE` must be configured accordingly.
- If you are connecting to RQUEST, read the [guidance on configuration](/bunny/how_to/connect_rquest).
- If you use another method to set your environment variables, follow the example above and [configuration](/bunny/config) documentation.

### Installing dependencies

Install the project dependencies using the following command:
```bash copy
uv sync
```

### Run the CLI

To run Bunny without a upstream API, the command-line interface can be used. This takes a query from a file.

To execute a query using the CLI, run the following command from the project root directory:
```bash copy
uv run bunny --body tests/queries/availability.json
```

This will write the result for your query to `output.json`, and log the result to the console.

We recommend this workflow to run queries and quickly iterate in development.

### Run the Bunny daemon

If you are connecting to an upstream Task API, you can use the Bunny daemon to poll the tasks endpoint.

```bash copy
uv run bunny-daemon
```

You should then see messages in your console like this:

```bash
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:24 - Setting up database connection...
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:24 - Looking for job...
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:29 - Job received. Resolving...
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:29 - Processing query...
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:30 - Solved availability query
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:30 - Job resolved.
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:35 - Looking for job...
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:40 - Looking for job...
INFO - 12-Nov-24 12:36:45 - Looking for job...
```

- Bunny establishes a connection to your OMOP CDM database, then polls the upstream Task API for a task.
- When it receives a task, it processes the query, queries the database, and returns the result.

For debugging purposes, you can run Bunny directly from the source code by executing the `bunny-daemon` script in the `src/hutch_bunny` directory. This allows you to use your IDE's debugger - we've included preconfigured debug settings for VSCode in the repository.

### Running Tests

To run the test suite for the repository, run:

```bash copy
uv run pytest
```
